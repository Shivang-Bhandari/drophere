A small drag-and-drop file uploader I created which uses the file type to upload it to relevant file-hosting service.
Text files are uploaded to Pastebin and Image files to Imgur.
I created this to play with CoffeeScript, Node.js, Express.js and HTML5 Drag and Drop

Live demo at: [DropHere](http://drophere.herokuapp.com)

If you are looking for code, the main files to look at are:
 * lib/service.coffee
 * public/javascripts/script.coffee
 * routes/upload.coffee

Any suggestions, pull requests would be great :). I wish to add more file types and hosting backends soon.
